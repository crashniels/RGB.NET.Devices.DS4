This Project adds RGB.NET Support for the PS4 controller via DS4Windows. As a DeviceProvider I used https://github.com/CyanLabs/RGB.NET.Devices.CorsairLink as a reference. It pretty much has the basic setup needed to get a DeviceProvider up and running. Also thanks to the guys over at DS4Windows (https://github.com/Jays2Kings/DS4Windows) for making this awesome Program. Without their DS4Windows DLL I would not have been able to make this.
